# <span style="color: #32ae62;">Liquor Compatability</span>

Liquor is our Compatability layer for Anura. We named it liquor because its similar to how wine works.

If your wondering what version of anura liquor is based off of, its based of Anura v2.1 "Starboy", as of now Liquor mostly targets almost all of Anura v2.1's APIs
